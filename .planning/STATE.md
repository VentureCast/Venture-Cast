# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-03)

**Core value:** Every trade prices on the bonding curve and settles atomically with a penny-balanced double-entry ledger and a reserve that never goes negative — provable by the $205 oracle and a 10k-trade-per-tier simulation.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Data Model & Market Genesis

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [All phases]: In-process Node engine (one Mongoose txn spans pricing + ledger + balances → real atomicity).
- [All phases]: Plain JS + CommonJS + JSDoc money typedefs (no TS toolchain) — match existing backend.
- [Phase 2]: Integer cents everywhere; `k` as rational `k_num/k_den`; spread→reserve, fee→platform_fees; genesis s0=0 @ P0.
- [Phase 1]: Internal double-entry ledger authoritative; platform_funding seeds reserve (no Stripe dependency this milestone).
- [Phase 4]: Build alongside existing trade path, flag-gated — no rip-out of `executeBuy/executeSell`.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Test infra gotchas (from project memory): use `MongoMemoryReplSet` not `MongoMemoryServer`; call `await Model.init()` on all txn-involved models before tests; keep inserts in-session via `new Doc({...}).save({ session })` not `Model.create()`.
